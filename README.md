Final Project for data structures spring 2016. Our group is planning to have a program that can read in a file of groceries, types, prices and stock and the user would be able to go shopping and choose the items they would like to buy. Then it will allow a check out and inform the user of how much it costs as well as what items/types they bought and reduce the stock.
