Project	Summary:
Final Project for data structures spring 2016. Our group is planning to have a program that can read in a file of groceries, types, prices and stock and the user would be able to go shopping and choose the items they would like to buy. Then it will allow a check out and inform the user of how much it costs as well as what items/types they bought and reduce the stock. 

How	to	Run:
When this project runs, a menu will first open up with four different options.

1: Print Inventory
2: Shop Item
3: Check Out
4. Delete item in cart
5. Print amount of options
6: Quit

(1) When the user presses 1 the entire list is printed out for the user. 
What is displayed is:
    Type: what the product is, such as milk, bread, vegetables.
    Brand: What the name of the product is, such as whole, white, carrots.
    Price: The cost associated with that item.
    Stock: How much of that item there is.
    
(2) When the user presses 2, hopefully looking at all the items gave them an idea of what they wanted.
    Enter Product wanted will pop up and type in the type of products you want. (EX: milk, bread, vegetables)
        

Dependencies:
Everything is included in file to run properly on codeblocks.
Do not use capitilzation or spaces while typing in.
Print (option 1) first to see options for buying. This will explain type vs brand.


System	Requirements:
Runs through codeblocks on VM. Will download the .cpp, .h and main.cpp if you would like to implement it using another option.
