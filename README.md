Project	Summary:
Final Project for data structures spring 2016. Our group is planning to have a program that can read in a file of groceries, types, prices and stock and the user would be able to go shopping and choose the items they would like to buy. Then it will allow a check out and inform the user of how much it costs as well as what items/types they bought and reduce the stock. 

How	to	Run:
When this project runs, a menu will first open up with four different options.

1: Print Inventory
2: Shop Item
3: Check Out
4: Quit

(1) When the user presses 1 the entire list is printed out for the user. 
What is displayed is:
    Type: what the product is, such as milk, bread, vegetables.
    Brand: What the name of the product is, such as whole, white, carrots.
    Price: The cost associated with that item.
    Stock: How much of that item there is.
    
(2) When the user presses 2, hopefully looking at all the items gave them an idea of what they wanted.

Dependencies:
This	section	contains	a	description	of	any	dependencies	that	your	program	requires.	
For	example,	if	your	program	relies	on	another	third-party	library	that	needs	to	be	
installed,	you	should	provide	a	description	of	where	to	find	that	library	and	
instructions	for	how	to	install	it	or	a	link	to	installation	instructions.

System	Requirements:
Is	your	program	for	Windows,	Mac,	Linux?	Are	there	additional	system	
requirements	other	than	the	operating	system?

Group	Members:
List	the	people	who	worked	on	the	project.
